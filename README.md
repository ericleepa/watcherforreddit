# watcher for reddit
A [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) app that uses [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to check for changes in reddit threads, subreddits, and users (new comments and submissions).

Watcher for reddit was desiged to be an easy way to track reddit content so that you don't need to save a link and remember to check it later.

You'll receive a notification in your reddit inbox any time that something you are watching gets new content.  You can select to be updated on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis.
